This directory needs to contain the not particularly huge lunar geoid
dataset from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission, in PDS format. It's
not checked in because... because. Feel free to download it yourself!

The dataset can be found on the Lunar Orbital Data Explorer website but
it's not possible to provide a direct link:

http://ode.rsl.wustl.edu/moon/indexProductSearch.aspx

It's actually easier to do a Google search for the actual filename and
get someone else's copy. The two files you need are:

	LDGM_4_GLGM-3_L60.IMG 
	LDGM_4_GLGM-3_L60.LBL 

(You need both. The .LBL contains the file header, the .IMG the actual data.
Ah, PDS --- bless.)
