This directory needs to contain the rather huge topography dataset from the
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera, in PDS format. It's not checked in because
it's six gigabytes. Feel free to download it yourself!

The images link to pages where you can get the raw PDS files. Note that we
don't want to TIFF files.

Both EQUIRECTANGULAR and POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC files are supported, badly ---
you'll need to download them both.
