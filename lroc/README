This directory needs to contain the rather huge topography dataset from the
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera, in PDS format. It's not checked in because
it's six gigabytes. Feel free to download it yourself!

The images link to pages where you can get the raw PDS files. Note that we
don't want to TIFF files.

Right now only EQUIRECTANGULAR projection PDS files are supported, and we can't
handle the POLAR STEREOGRAPHIC files used for the terrain around the poles. The
good news is that means you don't need to download the polar (toroidal) images
--- just the rectangular ones will do. The bad news is that this means the terrain
abruptly stops at about 60‚Å∞N.
