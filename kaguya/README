The Kaguya spaceprobe produced three sets of topographic data: a low-res
elevation map of the entire Moon, and high-res maps of the north and south
poles. As the maps use a spherical projection the low-res map is particularly
poor near the poles, so we combine the three to produce a high-res map of
the entire moon. This directory contains the data files and scripts to do
this.

The Kaguya datasets are available from their website here:
