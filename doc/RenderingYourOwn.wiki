<title>Rendering your own images</title>

Good choice! Getting into raytracing is an excellent way to use up vast
quantities of excess time and money.

Okay, I'll be blunt: while all the tools are here, they're not in great shape.
You'll need to do some hacking to make it all work. You'll also need to
download about 6.5GB of topography and geoid data, which for obvious reasons is
not included.

You will need a machine with about 16GB of RAM and as many CPU cores as you can
possibly manage. I developed it all on Linux, so you'll need to be used to that
kind of environment. (You may be able to get this working on Cygwin, but you
<i>really will</i> need to be able to build 64 bit binaries.)

Still interested? You can get the source via Mercurial via the Source tab
above; meanwhile, you might like to <a href="../README">read the README</a>,
which is where what we shall laughably call the documentation is.
